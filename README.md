# BreakerBoys
A class project where my team had designed a bluetooth circuit breaker switch
using a Arduino uno 3 and an esp 32 bluetooth module to build the circuit breaker switch
my team broke the project into seperate parts such as the desing of the switch or the code for the servos
and the code for bluetooth module to connect to a serial monitor on a smartphone.
My task was to find a way for the esp 32 to communicate from the phone to the uno which turns the switch on or off
